## Projects

### Project 1: Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

This project is a hands-on exercise where we perform web scraping using Python's BeautifulSoup library to extract data from a web page and analyze it using Pandas. The data extracted is focused on financial information, and we demonstrate how to clean, process, and visualize this data.

- **Web Scraping**: Using BeautifulSoup to scrape data from a table on a webpage.
- **Data Cleaning**: Processing and cleaning the scraped data to remove unwanted characters.
- **Data Analysis**: Storing the cleaned data in a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
- **Visualization**: Generating visual representations of the data using Matplotlib.

### Project 2: SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction

This project aims to predict the reusability of the first stage of SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets using data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques. Reusability is a critical factor in reducing the cost of space travel.

- **Data Collection**: Gathered data using SpaceX REST API and web scraping (Wikipedia).
- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaned, transformed, and prepared the dataset for analysis and modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed using SQL and visualization tools to uncover insights.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Created with Folium and Plotly Dash.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implemented machine learning models for classification tasks.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with Plotly Dash and deployed on Azure.
