##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full-cycle A/B testing analysis using real-world-style data. It walks through formulation of hypotheses, experimental design, statistical testing, and business-focused interpretation.

**Objectives:**
- Understand how to structure an A/B test using principles like PICOT (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Time)  
- Develop reproducible, data-driven conclusions to decide between two variants (A vs. B)  
- Learn key techniques such as hypothesis testing, statistical significance, and confidence intervals
