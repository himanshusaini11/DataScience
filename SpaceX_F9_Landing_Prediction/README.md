# SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the reusability of the first stage of SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets using data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques. Reusability is a critical factor in reducing space travel costs and increasing mission efficiency.

The project was developed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone and includes comprehensive workflows, from data collection to deploying an interactive dashboard.

## Features
- **Data Collection:** Gathered data using SpaceX REST API and web scraping (Wikipedia).
- **Data Wrangling:** Cleaned, transformed, and prepared the dataset for analysis and modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed using SQL and visualization tools to uncover insights.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Created with Folium and Plotly Dash.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implemented machine learning models for classification tasks.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Built with Plotly Dash and deployed on Azure.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Data Collection:** SpaceX REST API, BeautifulSoup (web scraping)
- **Visualization Tools:** Plotly, Folium
- **Databases:** SQLite
- **Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN
- **Deployment:** Azure App Service
