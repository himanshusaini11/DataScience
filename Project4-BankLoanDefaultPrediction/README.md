# Bank Loan Default Prediction Project

## Project Overview

The project involves creating a machine learning model to predict loan defaulters by analyzing synthetic financial and demographic data for 100,000 borrowers.

### Features

Data Generation: Synthetic data mimicking real-world borrower characteristics

Data Exploration & Cleaning: Identifying patterns and managing missing or inconsistent data

Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful predictors from raw data

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

## Getting Started

### Requirements:

Python (3.8 or higher)

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Faker (for synthetic data)

## Data Generation

### Synthetic data includes:

Age

Gender

Income Level

Employment Status

Loan Amount

Loan Term

Credit Score

Debt-to-Income Ratio

Previous Default History

Default Status (binary outcome)

## Usage
